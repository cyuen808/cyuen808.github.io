title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
This section will include power consumption estimates for each subsystem once the design is finalized.  
For now, this page serves as a placeholder with the Power Budget spreadsheet available for reference.  

The power budget will later calculate:  
- Current draw for each component (microcontroller, H-bridge, motor, etc.)  
- Power rail groupings (5 V logic and 6–9 V motor)  
- Supply margins and thermal headroom  

## Conclusions
This page will be updated after testing and measurement data are collected during the External Design Review.
