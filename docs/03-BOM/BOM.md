# Bill of Materials ‚Äì ClapSense Hub (Caleb Yuen)

This Bill of Materials (BOM) lists all electronic components and hardware needed to build and prototype the **Master Controller (Hub)** subsystem of the ClapSense project.  
The Hub uses the **PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano** as its core microcontroller and interfaces with other subsystems (Audio Front-End, Filter Board, Sensor Front-End) via an 8-pin ribbon connector.
