## Introduction
This datasheet explains the design and setup of my part of the project, the Master Controller or Hub, for the Team 204 Clap Activated Smart Light. It shows how my board connects with the Audio, Filter, and Sensor Front End boards, and how it controls the main actuator, which is the lamp that turns on and off when a valid clap is detected.  

The goal of this project is to create a smart lighting system that reacts only to real user input while staying simple to set up and safe to use with low voltage power.  



### Project Summary

Clapsense is built around a single Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano that serves as the Master Controller. The Audio Front End detects claps, the Filter Board manages user inputs and status lights, and the Sensor Front End measures room brightness to help the system perform better.  

The Master Controller processes all inputs and sends a command to the lamp actuator, turning the light on or off at the right time.  
This project combines key embedded system concepts—signal processing, sensor integration, and actuator control—to create a reliable and hands-free lighting experience.

### My Contribution
As the Team Lead of group and person in charge of the Master Controller, my role is to make sure all the other boards work together and to handle the signal that turns the lamp on and off.
