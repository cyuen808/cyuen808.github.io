Can only handle about 1 amp continuously, so it\u2019s not good for larger motors. Has built-in protection to prevent overheating or short circuits. The small surface-mount chip is tricky to solder without a breakout board. Allows you to control two motors or use both sides together for more power. The 3-amp peak rating only lasts a short time before the chip shuts down. </li> <li> <p>DRV8833</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$2.62/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Works with 3.3 V control signals, making it compatible with the Hub. Can get hot under heavy loads and needs good heat spreading on the PCB. Handles two motors and includes built-in protection for over-current, over-temperature, and undervoltage. Only comes in surface-mount packages, so it\u2019s not easy to use on a breadboard. Runs on 2.7\u201310.8 V, which fits perfectly in the project\u2019s \u22649 V limit. Needs a few extra small capacitors for stable operation, adding some circuit complexity. </li> <li> <p>2156-FAN8100N-FS-ND</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>On-Hand</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Works perfectly with your project\u2019s 6\u20139 V motor supply and 3.3 V logic from the Hub. Can only handle about 1.5 A per channel, which limits use to smaller motors. Has built-in protection features like thermal shutdown and short-circuit safety. Older chip, no longer in production\u2014can be harder to find replacements or breakout boards. Includes built-in diodes that protect against voltage spikes when motors switch direction.t Has a basic control setup (Forward, Reverse, Brake); requires extra PWM programming for smooth speed control. </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 1: Toshiba TB6612FNG</p> <p>Rationale: TB6612FNG is the most practical, low-risk driver for a 6\u20139 V system controlled by a 3.3 V MCU. It gives you reliable bidirectional control, braking, and PWM speed control with simple wiring and strong community support.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#dc-motor-options","title":"DC Motor Options","text":"<ol> <li> <p>FIT0495-A</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$9.90/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Uses very little current (~0.6 A stall), making it safe and easy for the TB6612FNG to drive. Turns slowly (about 15 RPM), so it\u2019s not good for fast-moving applications. Has high torque thanks to its metal gearbox; strong enough to press a button or lift small parts. Can only handle up to 7.5 V, so it can\u2019t use the full 9 V supply limit. Matches the system voltage (6\u20137.5 V) and provides smooth, controlled motion for precise actuation. The gearbox has some mechanical play (backlash), which can cause small delays or looseness in movement. </li> <li> <p>Adafruit 711 \u2013 DC Toy Motor (130 Size)</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.95/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Runs on 4.5\u20139 V, which fits perfectly within your project\u2019s voltage range. Has very low torque, so it\u2019s not good for pushing, lifting, or heavy mechanical tasks. Fast and inexpensive, great for testing motion, vibration, or quick demos. Comes without a gearbox or mount, so it\u2019s harder to attach to an arm or mechanism. Draws less than 1 A, keeping it safe for the TB6612FNG driver. Wears out quickly under long use, since it\u2019s a small hobby motor designed for short runs. </li> <li> <p>Portescap 16G88-213E.1</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$59.92/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Very efficient (\u224884%), which means less heat, longer battery life, and smoother performance. Expensive and harder to find since it\u2019s a precision motor meant for specialized applications. Low current draw (~0.55 A) keeps it safe for the TB6612FNG driver and prevents overheating. Low torque, so it can\u2019t handle heavy loads unless paired with a gearbox. High build quality and smooth operation, great for precision control or demonstrations. Requires custom mounting, since its small shaft and round body don\u2019t fit standard brackets. </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 1: DFRobot 6 V Metal Gearmotor (FIT0495-A)</p> <p>Rationale: The DFRobot 6 V metal gearmotor was chosen because its high torque and low speed provide smooth, controlled motion for pressing a button without bouncing or damage. It runs safely on the project\u2019s \u2264 9 V supply, draws less than 1 A, and pairs perfectly with the TB6612FNG driver for simple, reliable actuation.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
