Limited Continuous Current (\u2248 1.2 A) \u2013 Suitable for small/medium DC motors; sustained higher loads cause thermal rise or shutdown. Low ON Resistance &amp; Integrated Protections \u2013 0.5 \u03a9 output path plus built-in thermal shutdown and undervoltage lockout ensure safe, efficient motor control. Surface-Mount Package (SSOP-24) \u2013 Requires fine-pitch soldering or breakout board for breadboard use. Compact &amp; Reliable \u2013 Dual-channel design in one chip (CW/CCW/brake/standby), enabling bidirectional control of two DC motors or paralleled outputs for more current. Peak Current is Short-Term Only \u2013 3.2 A peaks allowed for milliseconds; not continuous\u2014must stay under 1.2 A avg per channel for safe operation. </li> <li> <p>DRV8833</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$2.62/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons 3.3 V logic friendly with nSLEEP/IN pins (VIH specs and internal pulldowns provided). Thermal/current derating: continuous current limited by PCB thermal design; device will TSD if power dissipation is high\u2014needs copper area/PowerPAD for heat. Good current + protections: up to 1.5 A RMS per bridge (pkg-dependent), 2 A peak; bridges can be paralleled; built-in OCP, TSD, UVLO, nFAULT, and sleep mode. SMD only (TSSOP/HTSSOP/QFN): not breadboard-friendly; follow layout + PowerPAD guidelines. VM 2.7\u201310.8 V, perfect for a \u22649 V project. External passives required: must place 10 \u00b5F at VM, 2.2 \u00b5F at VINT, 0.01 \u00b5F VCP, and (if using current limit) sense resistors\u2014adds a bit of BOM/PCB complexity. </li> </ol> <p>This is the example found in the assignment, uses more html</p> <p>Table 1: Example component selection</p> <p>External Clock Module</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.
