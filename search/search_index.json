The current schematic does everything it needs to for this project. It brings in power through the barrel jack and fuse, drops it to five volts using the LM7805 regulator, drives the motor with the FAN8100N H bridge, and communicates with the Audio, Filter, and Distance boards. Now that the board actually exists in physical form, it is much easier to see which parts of the design could be stronger or more reliable.</p> <p>The first improvement I would focus on is the power stage. Right now the Hub uses a linear regulator to drop nine volts down to five, and with the motor and the microcontroller both running off that same rail, the regulator ends up burning off a noticeable amount of heat. In the schematic you can see this entire path flowing through J1, the fuse, and into U1 before the five volt rail branches out to the rest of the board. A switching regulator would be a much better fit in a second version because it would waste far less energy and keep the whole board cooler, especially during long test sessions where the motor is running often.</p> <p>Another thing I would update is the motor driver. The FAN8100N works, but it is an older part and not very easy to replace or find documentation for. The schematic shows it tied to the PIC outputs on RB0 and RB1 and routed directly to the motor connector, so swapping it for a newer driver would be simple. Something like a TB6612FNG or a DRV8833 would make the design more future proof and easier for someone else to reproduce later since those drivers are still commonly used and supported.</p> <p>I also noticed that the current design does not include any way to monitor motor current or detect when the motor stalls. In the schematic the motor output is wired straight from the driver to the connector with only capacitors for stability. If I made another version I would add a small sense resistor and feed its voltage into an unused ADC pin on the PIC. That would let the firmware detect jammed motors or unusually high loads, which would make the system safer and more reliable. Along with that, adding more protection around the motor connector, like surge suppression or extra filtering, would help reduce electrical noise that can feed back into the rest of the circuit.</p> <p>Debugging was another area where I felt the limitations of the Version 1 board. The ribbon connectors work fine, but there are not many labeled test points for checking signals or measuring voltages. In the next version I would clearly label and break out points for ground, the nine volt input, the five volt regulated rail, the motor outputs, and important signals like the clap input and the PWM lines. This would make troubleshooting much easier and would reduce the risk of accidentally shorting something while probing the board during lab.</p> <p>The last major improvement I would look at is how much the design depends on the Curiosity Nano. Using the Nano made development fast, but for a cleaner and more advanced design I would put the PIC18F57Q43 directly on the PCB and include only the components needed to support it. This would free up board space, reduce cost, and bring the project closer to something that looks like a real commercial product rather than a prototype built around a development board.</p> <p>Overall, the Version 1 Hub works and has been a good learning experience, but Version 2.0 would focus on improving efficiency, safety, and reliability. Updating the power stage, choosing a more modern motor driver, adding current sensing, improving test point access, and eventually integrating the microcontroller directly onto the board would all make the system stronger and easier to work with. These changes would make the Hub more polished and durable and would help it hold up in real use beyond a classroom prototype.</p>"},{"location":"07-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/","title":"Power Budget","text":""},{"location":"07-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This power budget summarizes the electrical needs of the ClapSense Hub based on the final hardware and spreadsheet results. The hub uses a 9 volt, 2 amp wall adapter that supplies an LM7805 linear regulator, which provides a stable 5 volt rail for the whole system. Every major part of the board, including the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, the FAN8100N motor driver, the 6 volt gearmotor running at 5 volts, and the status LEDs, draws power from this regulator. When looking at the worst case numbers, the system uses around 655 milliamps. Adding a safety margin brings the expected requirement to about 820 milliamps. This is comfortably within the limits of both the LM7805 and the wall adapter, which means the board has plenty of room for startup surges, motor load changes, heat, and extra peripherals during testing. Overall, the final power analysis shows that the hub operates well within safe limits and has enough headroom for reliable performance.</p>"},{"location":"07-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#power-budget","title":"Power Budget","text":""},{"location":"07-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#downloads","title":"Downloads","text":"<p>The Power Budget template can be downloaded below:  </p> <ul> <li>Power Budget (.xlsx) </li> <li>Power Budget (.pdf) </li> </ul>"},{"location":"08-Resources/Resources/","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/Resources/#microcontroller-code","title":"Microcontroller Code","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/Resources/#team-code","title":"Team Code","text":"<p>This firmware controls the ClapSense Hub by combining motor control, clap detection, light-sensor gating, distance-based LED brightness, and UART logging into one integrated state machine.
